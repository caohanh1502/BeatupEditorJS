# Beatup Editor JS

#### (Ignore the "Source code" files, they are auto generated by github and are empty)

This is an offline version of Beatup Editor on my old website
(http://caohanh.com/beatup/editor/), written in javascript.



If you host this on your own website, it might not work correctly on some devices
(especially on iOS devices) because I removed some codes so it's completely offline.

If you have any questions, please contact me:

P/s: Due to my lack of coding experience, this app might not work well 8-}
