### Demo:

## Download (for using offline):
https://github.com/caohanh1502/BeatupEditorJS/releases

## Description:
This is an offline version of Beatup Editor on my old website
(http://caohanh.com/beatup/editor/), written in javascript.


### Note:
If you host this on your own website, it might not work correctly on some devices
(especially on iOS devices) because I removed some codes so it's completely offline.

P/s: Due to my lack of coding experience, this app might not work well 8-}
